# PlentyTestPlugin

A minimal PlentyONE (plentymarkets) plugin that overrides the storefront
homepage (`/`) with a hardcoded static demo page.

## Structure

- `plugin.json` — plugin manifest (namespace, service provider, dependency on `IO`)
- `composer.json` — PSR-4 autoload mapping (`PlentyTestPlugin\` → `src/`)
- `src/Providers/PlentyTestPluginServiceProvider.php` — boots the plugin, registers a route override for `/`
- `src/Controllers/DemoHomeController.php` — renders the demo template
- `resources/views/content/demo-home.twig` — the hardcoded homepage content

## How it works

The service provider's `boot()` method registers a `GET /` route that points
at `DemoHomeController::show()`, which renders `demo-home.twig` instead of
whatever the shop normally shows on its homepage (category page, CMS page, etc).

## Testing this

This plugin only runs inside a real PlentyONE backend — there's no local
runtime for it, so it can't be started or previewed from this machine. To try it:

1. Zip this folder's contents (or push to a Git repo) and upload it as a new
   plugin in your plentymarkets backend under **Plugins → Plugin overview → Upload plugin**.
2. Add the plugin to your active **plugin set** and set it to **active**.
3. Deploy the plugin set.
4. Open the shop's homepage — it should now show the hardcoded demo page.

## Note on the manifest schema

`plugin.json`'s exact required/optional fields can change between
plentymarkets platform versions. Before deploying, it's worth generating a
fresh plugin skeleton from your backend's **Plugin IDE / Plugin Builder** and
diffing its `plugin.json` against this one, in case your platform version
expects slightly different fields.
